# Necessary libraries
I have used 2 libraries 
1) Rake_NLTK (Free Library)
2) Monkey Learn (Paid API)

You can download any one of this and use it. 

# Choosing between Monkey Learn and Rake_NLTK
This depends on your necessary, if you need good model and ready to spend go for Monkey Learn else Choose Rake_NLTK.
By the way you can use Monkey Learn to a limit of 300 for free and so if you need just for a small Institute project I suggest go for Monkey Learn
